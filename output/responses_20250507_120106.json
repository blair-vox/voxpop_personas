However, I believe the benefits, such as potentially lower housing costs and a push towards more sustainable modes of transport, far outweigh these concerns.",

My concern stems from the fear that removing parking minimums will exacerbate the already challenging traffic and parking situation in our local area, directly affecting the quality of life for homeowners like myself. Living in a duplex and relying on local infrastructure to maintain property values and community standards, any policy that could potentially increase congestion without adequate alternative transport solutions or infrastructure improvements is alarming. The proposal seems to overlook the broader impacts on existing residents, favoring development interests at the expense of community well-being.",

My life, much like my art, strikes a balance between the need for accessibility and the preservation of our community's character. This proposal threatens to tip that balance unfavorably, exacerbating parking issues and potentially altering the neighborhood's vibrancy and accessibility that drew me here. I rely on my car for transporting art materials and pieces, and finding parking is already a challenge. While I support sustainable urban development, the lack of a comprehensive plan addressing the increased demand for street parking and the potential for overcrowded public transport makes me apprehensive. Our heritage, urban density management, and noise control are at stake, and this policy could undermine the efforts of those of us fighting to maintain Bondi's unique identity.",

My main worry, though, is that it could make parking even tighter for residents and visitors. If we're pushing for fewer car spaces in new developments, the council needs to ensure there's improved public transport and secure bike/scooter parking to support this change.",

Furthermore, as someone who values heritage protection, I worry that the character of our local area could be fundamentally altered by increased urban density without adequate infrastructure to support it. While I understand the need for more housing, the lack of consideration for additional support systems such as improved public transport or community facilities is alarming.",
