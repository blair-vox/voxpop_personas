    "narrative_response": "As someone living in Bronte and working in hospitality, I'm quite familiar with the challenges around traffic and the need for affordable housing in our area. While I generally believe in maintaining infrastructure that supports residents' needs, including parking, I'm intrigued by the proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new developments in Bondi. It seems it could potentially address the housing affordability issue by allowing for more living spaces instead of unused car spots. My support hinges on ensuring that such a policy wouldn't exacerbate traffic congestion and that there are sufficient alternative transport options in place. I'd be more inclined to fully support the policy if there were clear plans to enhance public transport and cycling infrastructure to compensate for the reduced parking availability.",

    "narrative_response": "Honestly, I'm a bit torn about Waverley Council's proposal to ditch minimum parking requirements for new apartments in Bondi. On one hand, as a Tradie, I know the importance of practical, accessible parking - it's not just about convenience, it's about livelihood for many of us. But, living in Tamarama and seeing the housing squeeze firsthand, I can't ignore the need for more affordable housing options for our youth. If this move could genuinely make housing more affordable and push us to be more climate resilient by encouraging public transport and walking, then I'm leaning towards support. What would change my mind? Clear evidence that it wouldn't just benefit developers' pockets but actually translate to tangible, positive outcomes for housing affordability and our community's carbon footprint.",
