  "narrative_response": "As a retired accountant living in Dover Heights with a keen eye on the local area's development and congestion issues, I'm quite skeptical about the proposal from Waverley Council to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. My concern is that it might exacerbate street congestion and reduce the overall quality of life for residents. While I understand the argument for more housing and less unused car spaces, as someone who values the heritage and the current balance in our community, I believe this policy could lead to more problems than it solves. A potential change of mind would require detailed studies showing a clear plan for how increased demand for street parking would be managed and evidence that this policy wouldn't detrimentally affect traffic flow and community character.",
