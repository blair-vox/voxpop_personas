  "narrative_response": "As a long-time resident and retired nurse, I have mixed feelings about Waverley Council's proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. On one hand, I understand the need for more housing and the benefits of encouraging public transport use. However, as someone who values mobility access and the stability of our neighborhood, I am concerned about the potential increase in parking and traffic congestion this could cause. It would take a comprehensive plan that ensures adequate public transportation and mobility access for all residents to change my mind.",
