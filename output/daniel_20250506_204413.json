  "narrative_response": "Look, as someone who\u2019s been around Tamarama and the wider Bondi area for years, I reckon this proposal's a bit of a mixed bag. I\u2019m leaning more against it, mainly because parking around here's already tighter than a rusted bolt. If developers start skimping on car spaces, it\u2019s only going to make finding a spot on the street tougher than it already is. That said, if there was a solid plan in place to seriously boost public transport options or some guarantee that it wouldn\u2019t just turn every side street into a parking nightmare, I might be swayed a bit. But as it stands, can't say I'm a fan.",
