  "narrative_response": "Honestly, I'm all for Waverley Council's proposal to axe minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. Given the chronic housing squeeze we're facing, it makes sense to prioritize living spaces over car spots, especially in a place as well connected as Bondi Junction. Plus, most of my mates and I hardly use cars \u2014 it's all about buses, walking, or cycling. The only thing that might sway me is if this change significantly worsens the existing parking woes for current residents or doesn't actually lead to more affordable housing options.",
