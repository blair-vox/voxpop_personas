  "narrative_response": "Honestly, I reckon this policy's not the best idea. Removing parking minimums sounds like it'd just make the on-street parking mess around Bondi even worse than it already is. I spend enough time driving around looking for a spot as is. If there was a solid plan to improve public transport or ensure that people moving into these developments didn't need a car, maybe I'd think differently. But as it stands, it's just going to pile more pressure on the locals.",
