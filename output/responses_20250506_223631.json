It's clear to me, living in North Bondi and getting around mostly by bus, that we could do with fewer cars and more green spaces or affordable housing options. The obsession with providing ample parking in new developments seems outdated, especially in a place with such good access to public transport and a community that values environmental sustainability. My main concern, though, is ensuring that this move doesn't just lead to developers pocketing extra profits without passing benefits like more green spaces or affordable units onto the community. I'd be swayed more firmly in favor of this policy if it included strict guidelines to ensure these savings are redirected towards community benefits.",

    "narrative_response": "As someone who has lived in North Bondi for a good part of my life and seen it change over the years, I have mixed feelings about this proposal. On one hand, reducing parking requirements could help alleviate the housing affordability crisis we're facing, making it easier for young families and individuals to find a place to live. However, I'm concerned about the impact on local transport and the availability of street parking, which is already a bit of a nightmare. If the council could ensure that public transport options are significantly improved to compensate, then I might be more inclined to support the policy. It's important that developers are also held accountable for contributing positively to the community, not just their bottom lines.",
