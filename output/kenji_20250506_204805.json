  "narrative_response": "As someone deeply invested in climate action and urban innovation, I'm inclined to support Waverley Council's proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. Reducing reliance on cars aligns with my vision for a more sustainable and efficiently planned urban environment. However, I believe success hinges on simultaneously enhancing public transport and cycling infrastructure to accommodate those displaced by fewer parking spaces. I'd reconsider my stance if evidence suggested this policy would significantly worsen traffic congestion or reduce public space without adequate mitigation strategies.",
