  "narrative_response": "As someone deeply involved in our community's development and character, I find myself conflicted over Waverley Council's proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. On one hand, I understand the argument for increased housing accessibility and the changing needs of urban residents, especially the younger population who may rely less on cars. However, as a Bronte resident who values the neighbourhood's character and the practicalities of living in such a densely populated area, I worry about the potential overflow effect on parking and congestion in surrounding areas, including Bronte. My support could be swayed by a comprehensive plan that includes robust public transport solutions and clear strategies to manage potential overflow parking in neighbouring areas.",
