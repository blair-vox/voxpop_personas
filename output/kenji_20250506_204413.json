  "narrative_response": "As a software developer deeply concerned about climate action and urban innovation, I find the idea of removing minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi quite forward-thinking. Given our need to reduce carbon emissions and the increasing reliance on public transport and alternative modes of transportation like scooters, this policy could help in making Bondi more sustainable and less car-dependent. My support, however, would be contingent on ensuring that the policy comes with robust investments in public transport and infrastructure to support non-car modes of transport, ensuring that it doesn't merely shift the problem elsewhere.",
